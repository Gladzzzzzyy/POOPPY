### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In today‚Äôs world, productivity is everywhere. Every time you open your laptop, there's this nagging feeling that you should be ‚Äúdoing something useful.‚Äù You sit down, ready to open a new tab, maybe take some notes, learn something new... but hold on! Isn‚Äôt this getting a bit too productive? What if ‚Äî and bear with us here ‚Äî we don‚Äôt want to be productive? What if we just want to‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ click around and waste time without feeling guilty?

The problem is clear: there‚Äôs simply too much emphasis on making every second count, and not nearly enough tools out there dedicated to pure, unadulterated time-wasting.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

*Pooppyy*: With each tap or key press, a cheerful emoji springs to life on the screen, accompanied by a matching sound effect. Emojis with different expressions appear randomly, filling the screen with vibrant animations. And when you‚Äôre ready for a fresh start, just hit the ESC key to clear everything.
